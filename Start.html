    <h2>Summoners War:Starting Out- Tips and Tricks</h2>
      <p>The game is really massive and takes a while to load. Once loaded you will have to play a walk thru guide that goes through<br>
      the main points. It can drag on a bit but is very helpful. I recommend listening and paying attention.<br>
      I would try to request as many friends as possible starting out to help get thru the harder stages.<br>  
      You can use a Rep Monster(Friends) to help once a day for every friend you possess.<br>
      Also try not to use any scrolls you acquire at first as they give you some decent monsters to play with as you progress.<br>
      This game has a massive following and they have weekly/monthly events that had out all sorts of in game goodies,<br>
      so make sure you check the event icon daily. You will be able to fight in the arena as well, so take advantage of that.<br>
      You will get crystals from winning the rival stages. They recently added a new progression tool to help guide users.<br>
      If you keep up with that you will get scrolls, crystals, and mainy other items to help with you along the way.<br>
